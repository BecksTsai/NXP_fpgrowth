    "introduction": "In the years when the severe outbreak of dengue fever is in Tainan, we cooperated with the Tainan government and proposed “Epidemic Prevention by Science and Technology”in the first instance. In the early stage of the project, through the mosquito man APP, we integrated the government information and let people report the mosquito activity. In addition, we let people know about dengue fever and the epidemic prevention information through the visualization of data. We also cooperated with Media Tek and deployed a large number of smart mosquito traps and egg traps to collect the high-density places of mosquitoes. Besides, we could know the dengue fever epidemic in advance through data analysis.",

    "introduction": "We cooperated with Junyi Academy Foundation and used students’ online learning records on Junyi Academy Platform to analyze their learning patterns. By doing so, we speculated students’ personality traits to know their personalities rather than just judging them by their scores of exams. For students, we can arrange an appropriate guidance to them according to their personalities. For companies, they can determine whether the student’s personality is consistent with the job needs when the student is applying the job.",
